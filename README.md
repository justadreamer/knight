# chess knight
Investigating the board coverage by a chess knight.  A board coverage means that a knight has to start at (0,0) (top right corner) and visit each cell exactly once, forming a (Hamiltonian) path.  Program outputs a board, with each cell marked by a position index of that cell in the knight's path.

## usage
Either compile directly:

```
swiftc knight.playground/Sources/knight.swift main.swift -o knight
```

or run 

```
./snapshot-test.sh
```

it will create an executable `knight`, which you can then pass the board dimensions (can be rectangular). f.e.:

```
./knight 5 5
 1  6 15 10 21
14  9 20  5 16
19  2  7 22 11
 8 13 24 17  4
25 18  3 12 23
```


You can use playground, but it works awfully slow on any non-trivial board.  
All in all program works awfully slow on any square board of size 6x6+.  
Rectangular boards for some reason are processed faster.  Looking for ways to optimize it, 
but without using any heuristics - just plain DFS in iterative manner with backtracking.  

## DFS with backtracking vs. bruteforce search
DFS (5^(M*N)) is obviously much faster than any bruteforce search (just checking each permutation of cells (M*N)!), but still is expnential and thus very slow.  But obvioiusly this is Hamiltonian path, humanity does not know a polynomial time algo to solve it (otherwise P==NP).
